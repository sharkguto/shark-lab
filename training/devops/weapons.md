## Tell me a truth

I saw many discussions about how to implement a truly DevOps culture, in many companies, and each company implements by their way... When I say it, means that from the small to bigger tech company, it will always be (Extreme) GoHorse methodology in the end.

As you can see, I was a true proof about it :laughing: :laughing: :laughing:

In fact, Bad software are be doing for decades , not because the developers are bad or good, but the delivery software process is weak. Also its happen because the entire company is not in harmony.

I like when everybody belongs to the product, the guy from marketing, IT professional ,sellers, managers to the secretary. Everybody needs to understand and use the product.

## Briefing

- Start using a Agile project management methodology as Scrum, Extreme, Crystal, Kanban, Lean,... and NO waterfall, please ! (only if your software has a deadline and will never change, in other words, a dead project)
- Use a good source control manager, like git.
- Give only the necessary access, who really needs it. A awesome security policy.
- Automate everything that is possible, and yes, I said everything... its include functional tests, deployments, integration with another tools,...
- Needs to have an excellent communication with the team
- Multiplatform application always
